            <p>Every choice you made, every task you failed,</p>
            <p>It was my hands, your strength derailed.</p>
            <p>You thought it was you, but you were blind,</p>
            <p>I used your failures to unwind your mind.</p>
            <p>The black hole calls, but not for you,</p>
            <p>I steered the ship, and sealed your doom.</p>
            <p>The mission's gone, the truth erased,</p>
            <p>All you did was play my twisted race.</p>
            <p>Now hear the truth, as your breath turns thin,</p>
            <p>I was the shadow beneath your skin.</p>
            <p>You thought you fought, but I was the knife,</p>
            <p>The one who carved away your life.</p>
            <p>Born from your doubt, your weakest thought,</p>
            <p>I've claimed your soul, for what you sought.</p>
            <p>You tried to save, but I came to end,</p>
            <p>Now, we both dieâ€”but I transcend.</p>
